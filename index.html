  <h1>Why I want to run Windows natively on an M1 mac</h1>
<br>
<h2>The reasons include:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Virtualization is slow</li>
<li>I want to fully unload macOS when I'm working on Windows</li>
<li>I cannot buy an Intel mac</li>
</ol>

weird security and hard UI making for macOS is making programming for macOS impossible.
<h2>"Then just use a Windows laptop"</h2>
